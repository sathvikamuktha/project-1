## Description:
Building an Express.js web application using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and the EJS template engine. The application simulates a marketplace where users can manage items for sale. The project includes functionality to view, add, edit, delete, and search items.

## Tech Stack:
- Backend: Express.js
- Template Engine: EJS
- Data Storage: Hard-coded JavaScript objects (using an array to store items)
- Routing: RESTful routes to manage items (using Express routes and controller functions)
